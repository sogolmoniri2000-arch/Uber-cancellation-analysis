# Uber-cancellation-analysis
Data analysis project on Uber ride cancellations and prediction of customer cancellations using machine learning.

# Uber Cancellation Analysis 🚖

## Overview
This project analyzes Uber ride cancellations to understand why customers and drivers cancel rides.  
We used data analysis and machine learning to find patterns and predict the probability of customer cancellations.  

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with charts (ride distance, booking value, number of travels, cancellations)  
- Comparison between Customer vs Driver cancellations  
- Top reasons for customer cancellations  
- Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer cancellations  

## Results
- Accuracy: 96%  
- Most important factors affecting cancellations:  
  1. Avg VTAT (waiting/vehicle time allocation)  
  2. Pickup location  
  3. Drop location  

## Conclusion
Most cancellations were marked as Unknown, but waiting time and location strongly affect whether a customer cancels.  
This project shows how data analysis + machine learning can help Uber improve customer experience.
